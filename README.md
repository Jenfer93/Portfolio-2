# Hello!

So happy to see you here :v:

### My name is Jenny, and I'm from Norway!

I am a front-end developer, currently working as a consultant at Ikomm AS in Lillehammer, a IT-service provider for several countys in Norway.

**Languages and frameworks I've learned this far:**

- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] Bootstrap
- [x] SASS
- [x] JavaScript
- [x] TypeScript
- [x] React
- [x] SvelteKit

I also love to design and in most of my design I focus on KISS (keep it simple, stupid). And always keeps the UI and UX in mind when creating applications.
If you want to have a look at some of my work you will find my portfolio here: [My portfolio](https://startling-sundae-ba85cc.netlify.app/).:raising_hand:
